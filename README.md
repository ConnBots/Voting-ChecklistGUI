# Voting/Checklist GUI

This is a simple checklist GUI that ive decided to make for my media class originally, but decided it would be cool to further support and make an actual project out of it! 

The **Main** supported version is the Python releases. HTML5 Is still currently a pre-release and still needs more updating for it to be more stable and support more features.  

**Current Versions:**
1. HTML5: [v.0.0.1-alpha-HTML5](https://github.com/ConnBots/PythonVoting-ChecklistGUI/releases/tag/v.0.0.1-Alpha-HTML5) || **PRE-RELEASE**
2. Python: [v.0.0.1-alpha](https://github.com/ConnBots/PythonVoting-ChecklistGUI/releases/tag/v.0.0.1-Alpha) || **STABLE RELEASE**

**Upcoming Versions**

# Information

      ## Editing the script. 

      ######  Editing Group Names (Python) 

   Currently, it is reccommended you do not mess with the names in the code, but if you would like to, heres how you do it. 

   When going into the script, you will have to edit the **var_states** Atribute. There is currently **4** Groups added, to change these, Just delete the group text (ex: Group1) and replace it with your own. 

   Once youve done this, you then have to change the text in the checkbutton sections. (Ex: If your var is Group10 then youll have to change the "text=" to Group10) These are **Case Sensitive**. 

      ###### Editing Group Names (HTML5)

   It is reccommended you do not change the atributes in the HTML5 Script due to it being somewhat complicated for users. A Step-by-Step instruction will be added later as the script gets more stable.
